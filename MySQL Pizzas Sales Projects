🔍 Pizza Sales Analysis Using SQL 🍕📊
Data-driven decisions are the backbone of any successful business, and the food industry is no exception! My latest SQL project focuses on Pizza Sales Analysis, 
where I explore customer preferences, sales trends, and revenue insights using structured queries.
🚀 Project Overview:
 I worked with four key tables:
 📌 order_Details – Tracks individual pizza orders, quantity, and price.
 📌 Pizzas – Contains details about pizza sizes and pricing.
 📌 orders – Records order timestamps and customer information.
 📌 Pizza_Types – Stores pizza categories, ingredients, and descriptions.
I used SQL to extract meaningful insights to understand peak sales hours, top-selling pizzas, and revenue-generating strategies. 📈
